2635,There aren't any little boys on your floor.,He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
2636,Did everyone call everyone?,They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
2637,What's that got to do with it?,When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.

2653,He sure loves to stay awake.,That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
2654,"Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.",I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
2655,Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.,"Greta, come on.  One burger with me?"
2656,My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.,Well we gotta do something!
2657,I've got to write some of this down.,That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
2658,"Mark, are you okay?",Yeah.  I'm just aces.
2659,I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...,"I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?"
